'''
The following code keeps looping forever. 
(You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) 

Why does the loop keep running? 

Modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.

iterations = 0

while iterations < 1:
    print("and on")
    iterations += 1

# or....

while True:
    print("and on")
    break
